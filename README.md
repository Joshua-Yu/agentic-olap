# Agentic OLAP
Traditional OLAP re-designed using agentic + genAI technologies 

Integrating Large Language Models (LLMs) and agentic architectures into an Agentic OLAP system, layered over a semantic layer and traditional OLAP engines, represents a cutting-edge evolution in data analytics. This approach aims to enhance the capabilities of traditional OLAP systems by infusing them with advanced natural language processing, intelligent automation, and adaptive decision-making. 

To determine whether an Agentic OLAP system provides a better solution, it is essential to explore its components, benefits, potential challenges, and how it compares to existing modern data platforms like Databricks and Snowflake. This repository is created to share development and resources in this space.
